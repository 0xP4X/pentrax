PentraX: Cybersecurity Collaboration and Innovation Platform (MVP Feature Breakdown)

Goal:
Build a secure, modern web app for cybersecurity engineers to share tools, report vulnerabilities, publish ideas, collaborate, and monetize content. Below is an in-depth breakdown of how each feature works in MVP terms.

---

1. User System (MVP)
- Registration/Login: Users sign up with email/password (JWT-based auth). Optionally, OAuth2 with GitHub for quick onboarding.
- Profile: Each user has a profile page with editable fields: name, skills, avatar, banner, and about section. Minimal UI: profile edit form, profile view page.
- GitHub Integration: Users can link their GitHub account (OAuth2). Public repos are fetched and displayed on their profile (read-only, no write access).
- Social: Users can follow/unfollow others. Simple follower/following lists on profile pages.
- Badges & Reputation: Users earn badges for actions (e.g., first post, first sale). Reputation is a numeric score based on contributions (posts, sales, bug reports). Displayed on profile.

2. AI Assistant (MVP)
- Always-available popup/chat widget (bottom-right corner).
- Powered by GPT-4 (OpenAI API key set by admin in dashboard).
- Users can ask questions, get tool explanations, or request lab hints. Simple chat UI, no conversation history persistence in MVP.
- Admin can update the API key from the admin dashboard.

3. Forum Modules (MVP)
- Forum is divided into categories: Tools, Bugs, Ideas, Jobs & Collabs, Docs & Projects.
- Users can create posts in each category. Each post has a title, body (Markdown editor), optional file/link attachment.
- Commenting: Users can comment on posts. Simple threaded comments.
- Search and filter by category/tag.

4. Cyber Labs (MVP)
- Labs are listed on a dedicated page, each with a title, description, difficulty, and tags.
- Each lab has a real-time terminal (xterm.js) connected to a backend (Docker container or simulated shell for MVP).
- Labs include hints (shown on request), and a leaderboard (top scorers by completion time).
- Users can attempt labs, submit flags/answers, and see their progress.

5. Monetization Engine (MVP)
- Store page lists scripts, tools, bug reports, PDFs, and training material for sale.
- Users can upload content, set price (or mark as free/premium).
- Payment integration (Paystack or Stripe; admin sets API keys in dashboard).
- Purchases tracked in user dashboard (My Purchases).
- Platform takes a commission (configurable by admin).

6. Admin Dashboard (MVP)
- Admin login (separate from user login; default credentials set on deploy, must be changed).
- View/manage all users, posts, labs, and store items.
- Ban, mute, or promote users (role management).
- Set featured tools/users (appear on homepage or highlighted sections).
- Update AI API keys, payment keys, and pricing models.
- Analytics: basic stats (user count, sales, downloads, views).

7. Notifications & Real-time Updates (MVP)
- In-app notifications for new comments, sales, replies, or tags (bell icon in navbar).
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling (MVP can use polling for simplicity).
- Night mode/light mode toggle (UI theme switcher in settings or navbar).

UI/UX (MVP)
- Responsive layout (sidebar + dashboard style), inspired by GitHub/Google Developers.
- Light and dark themes (toggle in settings).
- Markdown editor for posts/docs (simple, with preview).
- Minimal, clean design prioritizing usability.

Tech Stack (MVP)
- Frontend: React (with Tailwind CSS), or HTMX/Alpine.js for lighter builds.
- Backend: Python Flask or FastAPI.
- Database: PostgreSQL (admin can update DB URL in dashboard).
- Auth: JWT + OAuth2 (GitHub login).
- AI: GPT-4 via OpenAI API (configurable key).
- Payments: Paystack or Stripe (configurable key).
- Hosting: Render.com, Railway, or Hetzner VPS.

Security (MVP)
- HTTPS enforced.
- RBAC: Roles for admin, premium, and free users.
- Rate limiting, XSS/CSRF protection on all forms.
- Secure file uploads (extension/type validation).
- Audit logs for admin actions.

Monetization Summary (MVP)
- Paid script uploads (platform commission).
- Premium lab content or early access.
- Paid featured content (pinning posts/tools).
- GitHub sponsor links on profiles.
- Optional SaaS APIs for automation tools.
